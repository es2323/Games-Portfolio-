Games Portfolio - 
This repository showcases a series of games I developed during a 12-week university course. The portfolio includes recreations of classic games such as Pong, Peggle, Breakout, and Mario, all built using Unreal Engine 5 and coded in C++.

Featured Games:
Pong: A modern take on the classic arcade game with smooth ball physics, collision detection, and boundary handling. The ball's movement logic is coded to react to screen boundaries and collisions, as demonstrated in the sample snippet included in this repository.

Peggle: A fun, physics-based game where the player aims to shoot a ball and hit as many pegs as possible. Utilizes advanced physics simulations to create realistic bounce effects and interaction with the environment.

Breakout: A brick-breaking game where the paddle and ball mechanics are fine-tuned for precise control, allowing for a challenging yet rewarding gameplay experience.

Mario: A reimagining of a classic platformer, featuring character movement, jumping mechanics, and interactions with various in-game objects.

Technologies Used:
Unreal Engine 5: Leveraged the power of UE5 to create visually appealing and performance-optimized games.
C++: All game logic and mechanics are implemented in C++, making full use of Unreal Engineâ€™s powerful game development framework.
2D Physics & Collision Detection: Implemented physics and collision systems for each game to ensure smooth gameplay and accurate interactions.
This portfolio demonstrates my skills in game design, physics implementation, and software development, showcasing the full lifecycle of game creation from initial concept to playable demos. Feel free to explore the codebase and contribute!
